# BMI Calculator

This is a simple, open-source BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator project built using PyScript. This project is intended as a fun way to test and explore the capabilities of PyScript.

## Project Overview

The BMI Calculator is a web-based application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters). The application then calculates the BMI and categorizes the result into one of four categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- PyScript

## How to Use

1. Enter your weight in kilograms.
2. Enter your height in centimeters.
3. Click on the "Calculate BMI" button.
4. The application will display your BMI and the corresponding category.

## Code Overview

The core logic of the application is written in PyScript, a Python-like language that runs in the browser. The PyScript code is embedded in the HTML document and is responsible for handling user input, calculating the BMI, and updating the DOM with the results.
